#Hello paybyphone guys

##Install
Please make sure you have the latest java JDK installed on your system for the protractor/selenium tests. Also, the latest versions of the grunt, grunt-cli and bower should be installed globally. After that, just run the npm and bower installs.

'grunt test' will run all of my tests. 'grunt serve' will start up a localserver instance on port 9000 where you can see the site in action. The grunt file is just something I had lying around and that I revamped. There's some cruft in there that I haven't cleaned up. Please don't hold it against me.

Thanks guys, hope you're impressed.
